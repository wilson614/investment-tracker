# Tasks: UX Enhancements & Market Selection

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-ux-enhancements/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are included per project convention (unit tests for domain logic, integration tests for critical paths).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Backend**: `backend/src/InvestmentTracker.{Layer}/`
- **Frontend**: `frontend/src/`
- **Tests**: `backend/tests/`, `frontend/tests/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-10)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
  - US1 and US2 are both P1, can be done in parallel
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1)**: Can start after Phase 2 - No dependencies on other stories
- **US2 (P1)**: Can start after Phase 2 - No dependencies on other stories
- **US3 (P2)**: Can start after Phase 2 - Uses existing performance API
- **US4 (P2)**: Can start after Phase 2 - Affects position calculations (test carefully)
- **US5 (P3)**: Can start after Phase 2 - Simple route change
- **US6 (P3)**: Can start after Phase 2 - Frontend-only changes
- **US7 (P3)**: Can start after Phase 2 - Frontend-only changes
- **US8 (P3)**: Can start after Phase 2 - Frontend-only changes

### Parallel Opportunities

Within Phase 2:
- T005, T006, T007, T008 can all run in parallel

Within US1:
- T011, T012, T017, T018 can run in parallel

Within US2:
- T023, T024, T025, T026, T027, T029 can run in parallel

Within US4:
- T036-T041, T043, T044, T046 can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch parallel backend tasks:
Task: "Create GuessMarketService in backend/src/InvestmentTracker.Domain/Services/GuessMarketService.cs"
Task: "Add unit tests for GuessMarketService in backend/tests/InvestmentTracker.Domain.Tests/Services/GuessMarketServiceTests.cs"

# Launch parallel frontend tasks:
Task: "Add market dropdown to TransactionForm in frontend/src/components/transactions/TransactionForm.tsx"
Task: "Add guessMarket utility function in frontend/src/utils/marketUtils.ts"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (migrations)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (entities, DbContext)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (market selection)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test market selection end-to-end
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add US1 (Market Selection) → Test → Deploy (MVP!)
3. Add US2 (Benchmark) → Test → Deploy
4. Add US3-4 (Chart, Split) → Test → Deploy
5. Add US5-8 (UX Polish) → Test → Deploy

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- US4 (Stock Split) affects position calculations - test thoroughly with edge cases
